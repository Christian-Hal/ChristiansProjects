Room Adventure. By Christian Hall

The base game consisted of all of the building blocks. Which contained...
4 rooms
1 death option
3 grabbables
3 verbs (take, go, and look)

After some tweaks and and a bit of coding additions include...
12 rooms (8 new)
2 death options and a win option
8 Grabbables
4 verbs (take, go, look, and *use*) use allows the grabbales to interact with either the character or different locations



NOTE... Christian is not an artist and used MS paint to create the room images... so sorry they aren't pretty
